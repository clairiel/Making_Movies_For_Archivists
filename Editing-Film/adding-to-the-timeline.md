# Now the media is in our playlist, it's time to add it to the timeline.

+ We can drag and drop items into the timeline, or select them and then click to add them into the timeline.
+ Once clips are in the timeline, we can crop them, or stretch still images to the desired length.
+ Practice dragging, dropping and shortening/lengthening clips.
+ Practice rearranging the order of clips in the timeline. Note that when two clips overlap, a transition is automatically created.
