If you would prefer to work with your own materials, you're welcome to do that that too!
Particularly if you find the pace of the workshop a bit slow, you're welcome to browse the materials listed in the [tools and resources](https://clairiel.github.io/Making_Movies_For_Archivists/Foundations/tools-and-resources.html) section, and/or look for materials from your own institution to include.
