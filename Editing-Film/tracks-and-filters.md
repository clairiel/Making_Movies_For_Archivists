# Tracks
+ Creating multiple tracks allows us to combine multiple elements in the same time frame, such as audio tracks and images.
+ Right click on the timeline, or select the three horizontal lines above the first track and select 'Track Operations' and then 'Insert audio track.'
+ Drag an audio track into the new 'A1'track you've just created.
+ Note that you *can* add audio into a video track, but cannot add video into an audio track (if you do, Shotcut will import an extracted audio file from the video).

# Filters
+ Filters are where the movie magic happens! Select an image in the timeline, and then, in the 'playlist' window, navigate to the 'filters' tab.
+ Select the plus sign.
+ Here you'll see a library of audio and video filters. By selecting one, you're telling Shotcut you want to apply that filter to the clip you have highlighted. The next window that comes up will allow you to customize how the filter is used.
+ Note that you can copy and paste filters-- this is very helpful, particularly if you want to repeat the same effect multiple times.
