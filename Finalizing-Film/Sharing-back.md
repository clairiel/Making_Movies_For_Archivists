# Post-workshop survey
Our wonderful workshop organizers will circulate a post-workshop survey-- your feedback will be used to improve future iterations of the workshop, and is much appreciated!

# Discussion
+ What do you think of Shotcut?
+ What kind of videos can you imagine creating?
+ How do you imagine using videos in your educational, outreach, and/or advocacy activities?
+ How can we support each other in creating video content, and collaborate on future video projects?
+ What opportunities might there be to partner with film industry or film students to create movies with archival materials/about archives?
