# Visual Considerations

## Colour Contrast
  Particularly important when considering titles and text on screen, colour contrast should be checked for minimum compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Read more on contrast and colour [here](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/). You can also use the Web Accessibility in Mind's [contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to test your colour choices for text and background colour.
## Flashing lights
  Be aware of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines' threshold for flashing lights, which can trigger seizures in individuals with photosensitive seizure disorders. You can read the specifics on this threshold [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/seizure-does-not-violate.html), but the main thing to keep in mind is to avoid more than three flashes in a one-second period.
## Ability to pause and stop video.
  When embedding video in a webpage, ensure that users have the ability to pause and/or stop the video altogether. See accessibility guidelines [here.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html)

# Audio Considerations

## Captions and transcripts
  Captions are essential for people who are Deaf and hard-of-hearing. While there are some tools which will auto-caption your film (including YouTube), these auto-captions should be checked and edited to be confirmed for full accuracy. Please see the accessibility guidelines on subtitles for more information [here.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/captions/#automatic-captions-are-not-sufficient) If you have created a script for a voice over in your movie, this can be helpful for creating captions, and can also be used to provide a full transcript for the movie.
### A few free tools for creating Subtitles
  + YouTube
  Any video uploaded to youtube will include automatically created captions. Within the YouTube studio, you have the opportunity to edit these captions for accuracy and correct timing.
  + [Amara](https://amara.org/en/videos/create/)
  Amara allows you to create subtitles for free, with the caveat that these are openly accessible to the public. For content that you'll plan on making public anyway, it's a great choice for creating subtitles, particularly if you won't be uploading your video to YouTube.
  + [Subtitle Edit](https://www.nikse.dk/SubtitleEdit)
  Subtitle Edit is a free and opensource editor for download on your personal computer. It's a great option for creating subtitles offline, and allows you to create, edit, and save subtitle files locally, which can be useful for ease of access and maintenance over time. 

## Background music
  Background music and other background noise should be kept at 20 dB below that of the foreground audio, or there should be a mechanism to mute it all together.
