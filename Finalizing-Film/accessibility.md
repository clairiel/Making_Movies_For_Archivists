# Visual Considerations

+ Colour Contrast
  Particularly important when considering titles and text on screen, colour contrast should be checked for minimum compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Read more on contrast and colour [here](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/). You can also use the Web Accessibility in Mind's [contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to test your colour choices for text and background colour.
+ Flashing lights
  Be aware of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines' threshold for flashing lights, which can trigger seizures in individuals with photosensitive seizure disorders. You can read the specifics on this threshold [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/seizure-does-not-violate.html), but the main thing to keep in mind is to avoid more than three flashes in a one-second period.
+ Ability to pause and stop video.
  When embedding video in a webpage, ensure that users have the ability to pause and/or stop the video altogether. See accessibility guidelines [here.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html)

# Audio Considerations

+ Subtitles and transcripts
  Subtitles are essential for people who are Deaf and hard-of-hearing. While there are some tools which will auto-caption your film (including YouTube), these auto-captions should be checked and edited to be confirmed for full accuracy. Please see the accessibility guidelines on subtitles for more information [here.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/captions/#automatic-captions-are-not-sufficient). If you have created a script for a voice over in your movie, this can be helpful for creating captions, and can also be used to provide a full transcript for the movie.

+ Background music
  Background music and other background noise should be kept at 20 dB below that of the foreground audio, or there should be a mechanism to mute it all together.

  For a helpful checklist of considerations for audio and video please see Deque University's audio/video checklist [here.](https://dequeuniversity.com/checklists/web/audiovideo)
