# Sound basics

+ Editing an audio file for sound quality is best done in another program, such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).
+ In Shotcut, we will use filters to fade audio in and out.
+ You may also want to use multiple audio tracks to import sound effects, background music, voice over, and audio from video clips and/or archival audio materials. Keyframes are extremely useful for this!
