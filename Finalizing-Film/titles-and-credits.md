# Titles and Credits

## Titles

+ You can use titles to initiate and end your movie, as well as to divide sections within the movie.
+ Titles can be created in Shotcut, using the filters feature.
+ You can also create titles using another platform such as Canva, or a text editing platform such as Microsoft Word. Once you have saved your titles as an image (either by downloading/saving as an image file, or taking a screenshot of the text) you can import them into the Shotcut.

## Credits

+ To achieve a scrolling effect, credits are best created in Canva itself.
+ Unless you want the credits to play against an image, we will import a colour to display in the background.
