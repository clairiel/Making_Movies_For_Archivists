# Dynamic narratives

Take a moment and think of a movie you watched that held your interest. Now think of one that you found boring. What differences do you note between the two?

With film, we have the opportunity to combine images, sound, and text. Even with very simple elements, we can create a dynamic narrative.

## Movement

Adding movement is a key way to make a film more engaging for viewers.

Suggestions:

+ Add movement to text and/or still images using effects such as pan and zoom
+ Film a walkthrough of your space
+ Film yourself leafing through a favourite folder, opening a box, or pulling a photograph from an envelope

## Rhythm

The pace of shots, in addition to music and movement within shots creates a rhythm.

Suggestions:

+ Combining several still images at a regular pace creates a steady rhythm which you can speed up or slow down. Have fun experimenting with slowing the rhythm of the narrative down or speeding it up as the movie progresses!
+ Match changing shots or image effects with the beat of background music tracks.
+ Rhythm can also be created visually with repetition of colour, patterns, shapes etc.

## Contrast

Contrast can be a powerful way to create a dynamic narrative. You can apply contrast to rhythm, movement, and to the images or shots you choose to include in your movie.

Suggestions:

+ Use contrast to showcase differences in materials-- the breadth of items in your collections!
+ Contrast a slower portion of your movie with a faster-paced one.
+ Contrast type of shot-- text-based, still-image, moving image-- animation or live shot!

## Emotion

While it's outside the scope of this workshop to discuss story-boarding, writing a small screenplay, or any of the far more complex processes that go into movie magic, considering the overall emotion you want to convey can go a long way towards helping create a dynamic narrative.

Suggestions:

+ Select materials which you find particularly emotionally evocative and include them in your movies.
+ Music and sound-effects greatly influence emotional tone-- try a few different styles and genres each time you're working on a new project!
+ Ideally, movement, rhythm, and contrast will all work together to cohesively inform the emotion you want your viewers to experience! Watch for these elements in advertisements and movie trailers to see how the experts do it, and 'steal like an artist'!
