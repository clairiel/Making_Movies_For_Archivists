# What is Shotcut?

Shotcut is a free, open source, cross-platform video editor.

It's what's known as a timeline-based video editor, which allows you to import a wide-variety of media and drag and drop various elements onto the timeline to create a film.

Shotcut can be used for fairly advanced video-editing, but today we're going to focus on the basics: importing media, manipulating media, adding effects, and exporting as a single movie file.

Troubleshooting:

+ Restore default view
+ Save often
+ Force quit
