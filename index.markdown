# Welcome to our workshop "Making Movies for Archivists"

This workshop has been created for the Association of Canadian Archivists Professional Development program by Claire Williams. You are welcome to bookmark this page for future reference and use. 

This workshop is meant to introduce you to video-editing tools and platforms. We'll go over the elements of a dynamic and engaging film-based narrative. We will create a short movie using images and audio in the open-source movie editing software, Shotcut. We will also identify accessibility concerns when creating and sharing movies, and locate resources for creating accessible movies.

Thank you for joining!
